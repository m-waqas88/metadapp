# MetaDapp
This is a demo project in which I have used [useDapp](https://usedapp.io/) just to learn something new with fun. This is a utility that provides reactHooks to interact with Ethereum. Overall I found this utility very helpful for small scale projects.

In this projecy a user can simply visit the site, connect the wallet and the wallet address and balance will be displayed on the screen. Simple but productive!

Live demo of the Dapp can be experienced [here](https://metadapp.dappsbuilder.info/)
